# PyBer_Analysis 
## Overview of the analysis  
PyBer is a ride-sharing company who's looking for the impact of city type to weekly total ride fares. With the data sets provided by PyBer, we were able to put out a summary to show the total weekly fare, city type, number of drivers and rides. A multiple-line chart was also created to show the total weekly fare of each city type from January to April. At the end, we aim to provide some business recommendation to the CEO with the findings.
