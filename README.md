# PyBer_Analysis 
## Overview of the analysis  
PyBer is a ride-sharing company who's looking for the impact of city type to weekly total ride fares. With the data sets provided by PyBer, we were able to put out a summary to show the total weekly fare, city type, number of drivers and rides. A multiple-line chart was also created to show the total weekly fare of each city type from January to April. At the end, we aim to provide some business recommendation to the CEO with the findings.  
## Results
![Pyber_summary_df](analysis/Pyber_summary_df.png)
Above is the summary dataframe. It indicates that:  
* Urban cities have the highest total weekly fares, highest amount of rides and drivers.
* Rural cities have the highest average fares per ride and per driver.
* In urban cities, there are more drivers than number of rides.

From the line chart above, we can summarize that:
* Towards the end of Feburary, total fares were at a peak for all three city types
* In both urban and rural cities, total fares were slghtly decreasing during the mddle of April.

## Summary
Based on the analysis above, we would recommend to look into it deeper between the number of drivers and the demand of rides for each city type. In urban cities, there are more drivers available than the number of rides. It shows a more competitive situation in these areas. In Rural area, the amount of rides is almost two time of total drivers. This might result in a longer waitng time for customer and potentially losing existing cutomer. So I would suggest to run a deep analysis on the waiting time of each rides in different city type to decide if we should promote more to attract new drivers.  
Secondly, the average fare per ride and per driver is relatively higher in rural cities. It might be a result of longer drip distance. We suggest to run analysis to find the connectiong between city type and average trip distance. This would help us find out a more profitable area to promote the brand.  
The total weekly fare are mostly steady from January to April. There was a peak at end of Feburary for all city type. Suburban cities have a stronger April lift compare to the other two city types. We would want to look into it futher to see if there is a higher demand starting.
